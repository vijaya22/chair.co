# chair.co

I don't know why I named this chair.co . Maybe I was sitting in a cafe with beautiful chairs. I am really liking the idea of sitting in a chaotic place and doing coding. I think I will do this more. 

So the idea is to make color picker app. the normal extension will be a color picker icon. 

And whenevr someone clicks, it tells you the color of that pixel. 


Motivation behind this is that this is a simple idea and I want to complete the whole process for this app. 

So yeah, lets do this.
